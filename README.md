# AODNotify
AOD Notify is a WORK IN PROGRESS Always on Display app that adds Samsung like Ambient Screen to all supported android phones with AMOLED Display.
AOD Notify currently only supports it's core functionality. The app displays the Always On screen when the phone is locked after enabling the service.
The app also constantly shifts the position of the clock to prevent OLED Burn-In issues. The app currently partially supports showing notification
icons on the Always on screen after the required permissions are granted.
